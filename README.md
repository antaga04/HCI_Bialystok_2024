# Human Computer Interaction

Hello,

Please find below a list of tasks for this semester from subject HCI:

1a. Simple "hello world" application in text mode.

1b. More complex text mode application https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mode 
Created using MVC pattern: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller

Like a library of books for example.

For Java you can use Lanterna library: https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna

2. The same application, but in graphical windows mode (i.e. replace "view" module from above application). The best would be to allow user to switch between text mode and GUI mode of the application. In Java you can use AWT or Swing for this.

3. Create UX design, wireframes of more advanced application (approx. 10 screens) and navigation diagram. Can use Adobe XD, Figma, Cacoo

Note, you need to show these project during duration of the semester and present them personally. The deadline is end of semester.
